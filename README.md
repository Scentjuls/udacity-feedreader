This project is about testing a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included Jasmine and even started writing their first test suite.

#Objectives
The primary objective os this project is to show the skills learned during the udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree related to JavaScript Tools & Testing.

#How I completed the Tests
To build the tests I have used jasminejs to build all the tests that where asked in the project, and used Gulp to create a dist folder.

#Dependencies
To see the app;ication in action, clone the repo and run the app using a live-server from visual studio code. To install live-server go to the marketplace and search for a plugin called live server, install the plugin and run the app by clicking "Go Live".
